# Movie-Watchlist-Generator

## **Project Description**

### *Project Motivation & Purpose*

As frequent movie watchers, our group knows how cumbersome it can be to research movie titles and maintain a list of movies you are interested in. If you are not using a streamer like Netflix, you often times have to do your reseach on sites like IMDB and then compile a list of movies or soundtracks you are interested in exploring in a seperate document. Additionally, if you compile your list in one streamer, it is not transferable and is only limited to the movie catalog available to the streaming service.

Our motivation for pursuing this project - Movie Watchlist Generator - is to simplify the process of researching and compiling this information into one place that is not reliant on the usage of any one streaming service. We hope this website can help frequent movie watchers have space to plan out their future movie viewings.

### *What We Learned from Doing This Project*

Our group has learned how to use Tailwind to add CSS components to a webpage. Additionally, our group has to search and vet potential 3rd party APIs to help build our websites. We have focused on how to use JQuery to add interactivity to our webpage, and we want to continue to explore how we can add additional functionality to our website.

### *Direction for Future Development*

We hope that we can add future functionality to this website in the following ways:

1. Adding a calendar feature, so users can schedule out when they want to watch the movies they have saved to their movie watchlist.
2. Creating an archive where you can see movies you have watched and what day you watch it.
3. Adding Movie Trailer via YouTube as part of the Movie Title Information, so users can watch the trailer as additional information when they are deciding to add the movie to their watchlist.
4. Adding additional reviews such as Rotton Tomatoes and Audience Scores.
5. Users can preview songs listed as part of the movie songtrack through Spotify/Apple Music/Youtube Music/etc.
6. Users can follow links to major retailers to buy soundtrack album and/or singles.

## **Installation**

N/A

## **Usage**

This website allows users to search and review information about movies. Through completing a search, the user can get basic information about a movie (including title, plot, basic reviews, movie poster, etc). The user then has the option to add the title to a movie watchlist where they can view the titles they want to remember, view, and/or do further research on in one convenient place. This website can serve as one-stop shop for research as well as saving movies the user is interested in for future reference.
